# bookbot

**BookBot** is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

---

## 📚 Bookbot Project - Complete Overview

### 🛠️ What I Built  
A command-line text analysis tool that can read any book file and provide detailed statistics about it.

---

## 🚀 Core Features

- **Word counting**: Counts total words in any text file  
- **Character frequency analysis**: Counts how many times each letter appears  
- **Sorted results**: Displays character counts in descending order (most frequent first)  
- **Command-line interface**: Accepts any book file as an argument  
- **Error handling**: Provides helpful usage instructions when used incorrectly

## 🧠 Technical Skills You Applied

### 🔹 File I/O Operations

```python
def get_book_text(book_path):
    with open(book_path, 'r', encoding="utf-8") as f:
        return f.read()
```
🔹 Text Processing Functions
	•	count_words(): Splits text and counts words
	•	count_characters(): Analyzes character frequency
	•	sort_characters_by_count(): Sorts results by frequency

🔹 Command-Line Argument Handling
```python
import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Usage: python3 main.py <path_to_book>")
    sys.exit(1)
```
🔹 Data Structures
	•	Lists for storing word arrays
	•	Dictionaries for character counting
	•	List of dictionaries for sorted results

🔹 String Formatting
	•	F-strings for dynamic output
	•	Multi-line strings with \n
	•	Conditional filtering (alphabetic characters only)

⸻

🧭 Program Flow Architecture
	•	Validation: Check if user provided correct arguments
	•	Input: Read book file from command line argument
	•	Processing: Analyze text for words and characters
	•	Output: Display formatted results with headers and sections

⸻

📚 Books Analyzed
	•	books/frankenstein.txt
	•	books/mobydick.txt
	•	books/prideandprejudice.txt
